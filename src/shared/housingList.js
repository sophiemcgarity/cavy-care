        text: 'Fleece bedding has become one of the most favorite type of beddings among guinea pig owners. One of the reasons why a lot of guinea pig owners prefer using fleece bedding is mostly because of how cute their pets look when they’re burrowing and nestling in soft fleece. A quality made fleece bedding for guinea pigs features a soft fleece on its upper layer, the middle part should be made of absorbent cotton, and the lower layer should also be made with fleece or it could be waterproof. By using this kind of fleece bedding, your pet’s liquid waste will flow through the top fleece layer, then get absorbed by the middle layer to keep your pig warm and dry. The lower layer’s waterproof bottom would prevent the liquid from spreading everywhere in your pet’s enclosure.',

        text: 'If you consider using pine shavings as your pet’s bedding, then make sure that the pines are kiln-dried, soft, and natural. The great thing about pine beddings is that they are economical, highly-absorbent, and very easy to find as they are available in most pet shops. However, the natural pine oils could cause illness or irritation in both pet and owner, not to mention they could also get stuck on the cage or towels.',

        text: 'When using aspen as your pig’s bedding, make sure that the aspen is soft, dry, and completely free from additives. They could be pricier than pine beddings and less absorbent, but they could certainly provide your pet’s needs and help stimulate their natural behaviors such as burrowing, nesting, and others',

        text: 'The use of old recycled papers has recently emerged in the industry and a lot of pet owners has taken a liking to it. This is because the use of papers as beddings is surprisingly very absorbent, soft, great in controlling odor, and most of them are homemade. However, since they are mostly processed in a way to remove inks and chemicals, they could be quite pricey and a bit dusty to use.',
